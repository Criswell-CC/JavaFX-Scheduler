The Scheduler is a desktop application that provides international companies with the ability to manage appointments and customers through a user interface coded in JavaFX. It provides all the necessary timezone management for an international company and interacts with the company's MySQL database to display, add, update, delete, and report on data.

The IDE used to code this project was IntelliJ Community 2020.03. JDK 11.0.9 and JavaFX SDK version 11.0.9 were used.

To run this program: 
	--Download and install JDK 11.0.9 on your machine if not already installed and download the JavaFX 11.0.9 SDK.
	--Open the source folder of this project in IntelliJ and add the JavaFX library through File -> Project Structure -> Libraries and add JavaFX with the path to the JavaFX SDK on your machine.
	--Configure VM options through Run -> Edit Configuration and making sure the VM options include the path to JavaFX on your machine.
	--Run the project by pressing Shift+F10 or hitting the green play button in the top right corner.
	--Use other 'admin' 'admin' or 'test' 'test' for the username and password to log in to the application.

The additional report I chose to run is a report listing all appointments and ordering them by the user id of the user who created them.
